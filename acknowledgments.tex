\section*{Acknowledgements}

The work presented in this work is done as part of my Outreachy internship
with Debian. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Software Freedom
Conservancy, who run that program, helping women and members of 
underrepresented groups to start their journey in the world of Free and Open
Source Software, and Debian for sponsoring my participation in it.\\
I would also like to thank Reproducible Builds team for being such a 
friendly and helping community. I hope my work will let more people 
know about this project, so together we can achieve our shared goal.
I believe the work this project is doing is of great importance to all 
the software world, and I shall assist it in any way I can.\\
Special thanks to Mattia Rizzolo, my mentor, for all guidance and help!\\

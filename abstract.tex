Reproducible Builds is a collective effort of multiple open-source software
projects, aiming to provide a verifiable path from human readable source code
to the binary code used by computers. To achieve this goal, several tools were
created, allowing for identifying common sources of unreproducibility in build
process.
Diffoscope is one of these tools - it is designed to compare different kinds of
archives, binary formats and other types of files commonly used in software
development process. In this work, several improvements to diffoscope were
designed and implemented, making it more useful for projects working on
Reproducible Builds effort.\\

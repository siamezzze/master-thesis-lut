\nopagebreak[4]{
Since the main body of diffoscope source code is written in Python, PyTest unit tests are used to 
ensure the new features work as intended and do not break the existing ones.
Unit tests cover the behavior of every part in diffoscope, such as comparators for the
different kinds of files, various types of output formats, aspects of user-defined 
behavior and more.
Any significant change in the diffoscope should be backed up with a few tests 
that make sure the new behavior matches the expected one. \\
As for now, diffoscope test suite contains around 300 unit tests.

\subsection[Test cases for order-like difference]{New test cases}
\nopagebreak[4]{
  For every change introduced, there were several tests added.
  In particular, APK files comparison test suite was added to the project,
  and image comparison tests were refilled with tests checking image metadata extraction
  and comparison.
